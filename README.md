Customer churn power BI dashboard
This dashboard helps us to visualize and understand customer behavior. 
using 15000 data from bank customer, I built an interactive dashboard that shows trends in customer behavior like:
* many customer using credit card and are also representing active/inactive customer.
* customer are using credit card payment more comparison to debit, upi, etc.
* we can locate customer by location, status, age, gender and whether he exit or not.
  with clear visuals like bar charts, pie charts,slicer and kpi cards. this dashboard gives valuable insights that business can use to improve customer churn. it's fully interactive, so users can filter by different factors and instantly see how it affects churn.
